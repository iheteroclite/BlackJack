"""People classes in the game of blackjack.

The people superclass initiates attributes which are common between players
and dealers (e.g they both have a name and a hand). The player subclass
represents a blackjack player who can choose to hit, stand, or surrender.

The dealer has hard-coded difficulty co-efficients, but in future versions
these could be selectable at the beginning of game. The dealer can try to
catch players cheting, shout at the players and ban them from the game.
